# CHMS

This is my submission for my Breach Secure Now programming challenge.

It has been a challenge:

- I have not messed with MySQL in any meaningful way in a decade.
- Apparently I have not messed with GitHub in a while either...

This has been an interesting challenge.
There is soooo much more that could be done with this:

- more REST stuff
- I need better testing
- the whole front end of course.
- filling out letters, invoices, payments....
- set up dev ops things for building the DB, createing test data, and testing

I am sure I will think of more things, but I am about out of time and hope i did not forget anything significant.

The more I look a the Requirements and Deliverables, the more I see this more of a SQL challenge than a Python one.

# ERD

There may be some errors in there. I am not very familiar with all the symbols (been a very long time). Let me know if the link does not work.

# Tests:

- There is much more that can be done.
- real data could be put in and then checked
- should check the data sent to PUT and POST for some kind of validation

# Things to look at:

- wierd pathing on my machine that make imports messed up
